        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>To improve the documentation, education, marketing, and events of our framework to the benefit of all new and existing Rails developers, and to ensure a prosperous ecosystem that continues to improve for decades to come. Read <a href="/2022/11/14/the-rails-foundation">our announcement</a> for more details.</p>

        <h3>Our Work</h3>
        <p>The foundation will commission freelancers and firms to work on better written documentation, more compelling screencasts, exciting events, and much more. We've only just gotten started, so more detailed plans are still to follow.</p>
        
        <p>We will also be administering <a href="/trademarks">the Rails trademarks</a> through an exclusive licensee from the trademark owner.</p>

        <h3>Our Members</h3>
        <p>In alphabetical order, the eight founding core members of the foundation are: <a href="https://cookpad.com">Cookpad</a>, <a href="https://www.doximity.com">Doximity</a>, <a href="https://www.fleetio.com">Fleetio</a>, <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.intercom.com">Intercom</a>, <a href="https://www.procore.com">Procore</a>, <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a>, and <a href="https://37signals.com">37signals</a>.</p>
        
        <p>The foundation is open to new contributing members, who may apply for membership by writing to <a href="mailto:foundation@rubyonrails.org">foundation@rubyonrails.org</a> for more details. If your company has been benefiting from Rails over the years, but not sure how it might give back to the ecosystem, now there's a clear and obvious choice.</p>

        <h3>Our Structure</h3>
        <p>The foundation is a non-profit 501(c)6 foundation incorporated in the US.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />

        <h3>Our Board</h3>
        <p>The founding core members are each represented by one employee on the foundation's board, which is then chaired by the creator of Ruby on Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson.</p>

        <hr class="divider" />

        <h3>Our Budget</h3>
        <p>The eight core foundation members have together generously endowed the foundation with $1,000,000 USD in seed funding to make a real difference on all the aforementioned areas of improvement. Going forward, these members will contribute $400,000/year.</p>

        <p>We thus will not have to rely on funding from individual contributors.</p>
