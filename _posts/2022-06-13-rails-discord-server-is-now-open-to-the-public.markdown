In the past few weeks, the Rails team has been working on a few changes to lower the barrier for new contributors to the framework.

We started by [disabling the automatic closing of stale PRs](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/acf48169943011834c4c885b956e29050548fa98). This means that contributors can submit their PRs without
the fear of a bot closing their worthy contributions before a member of the Rails Team has a chance to review them.

To make it easier for contributors to recognize members of the Rails Team, we made public the [list
of current members of the Issues team](https://rubyonrails.org/community). The Issues team assists with
issues triage, pull request reviews and documentation improvements, so they are often the first
interaction users have with the Rails team.

Today, we are opening a Discord server to allow contributors to help each other and lower the overhead
to communicate with new contributors.

This new server is open to the public using [this invite link](https://discord.gg/8N68BCw49),
and is a great place to get help with the framework and learn how to contribute to it. This will also complement
the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues) and our
[Discourse forum](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/). It will follow the same
[Code Of Conduct](https://rubyonrails.org/conduct) as the rest of the Rails official spaces.

We hope to see you there!
